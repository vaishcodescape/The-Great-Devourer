# The Great Devourer Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C++ called "The Great Devourer." The game allows you to control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, with the goal of achieving the highest possible score while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to control the snake's direction (Up, Left, Down, Right).
- **Growing Snake**: Each time the snake eats food (represented by "O"), it grows longer.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- **Score**: Your score increases as the snake eats food.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- A terminal or console to run the game
- Windows, Linux, or macOS environment

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TheGreatDevourerSnakeGame.git
